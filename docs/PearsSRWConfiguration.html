<H1>Pears/Newton Configuration Instructions for the OCLC Research SRW 
Server</H1>When the SRW server starts, it is passed a single startup parameter 
(PropertiesFile) from the web.xml file. This points to a configuration file for 
the SRW server. That configuration file in turn points to a separate 
configuration file for each database hosted by the server. (See <A 
href="http://pubserv.oclc.org/srw/Installation.html">Installation.html</A> for 
more information on the SRW Server Properties file.) This document describes the 
contents of the configuration file for a Pears or Newton database. <BR><BR>The 
purpose of the database configuration file is to provide mappings from CQL index 
names to database indexes and to provide mappings from the database's internal 
record structure to specific XML schemas. It also provides configuration 
information for the underlying database searching software. In this case, that 
software is OCLC Research's Gwen search engine. <BR><BR>
<H2>Gwen Configuration</H2>Your configuration file needs two mandatory lines: 
<UL><B>Gwen.implementation=ORG.oclc.os.pearsgwen.pDatabase<BR>Gwen.updateMode=READONLY 
  </B></UL>Another mandatory parameter is <B>pearsgwen.inifileName</B>. It should 
point at a ZBase database.ini file. See the Index Mappings section below for 
more information about this file. An optional parameter is 
<B>pearsgwen.defaultOperator</B>. It specifies the implicit operator between the 
words in a quoted list of words. If omitted, the value defaults to OR. Legal 
values are: 
<UL><B>pearsgwen.defaultOperator=OR<BR>pearsgwen.defaultOperator=AND<BR>pearsgwen.defaultOperator=ANDNOT<BR>pearsgwen.defaultOperator=PROX 
  </B></UL>
<H2>Index Mappings</H2>Index mappings are kind of a pain right now. The problem 
is that the Gwen search engine is designed to support Z39.50 queries. So, the 
CQL queries that the SRW server gets are converted to Z39.50 queries and then 
Gwen has a configuration file that maps the Z39.50 query term attributes to 
Pears or Newton index numbers. <BR><BR>So, that means that you need two 
configuration files. If you are a SiteSearch user, the Gwen database 
configuration file is just the database.ini file that you've been using for 
ZBase. Look <A 
href="http://pubserv.oclc.org/srw/ZBaseGwenDatabaseConfiguration.html">here</A> 
for information on how to configure Gwen for ZBase. If you don't need Z39.50 
support or you aren't using SiteSearch, then you can get away with a much 
simpler Gwen configuration file. Look <A 
href="http://pubserv.oclc.org/srw/SimpleGwenDatabaseConfiguration.html">here</A> 
for those instructions <BR><BR>The SRW database configuration file contains 
information on how to map a CQL query to a Z39.50 query. It does this by 
specifying how the various parts of a CQL query map to their Z39.50 equivalents. 
Since the Boolean query parts are identical, the mapping really centers around 
how a CQL query term gets mapped to a Z39.50 query term. That, in turn, really 
centers around how the CQL index and relation specifications map to Z39.50 term 
attributes. The discussion below assumes that you have a database that is 
already Z39.50 accessible and you're just trying to figure out how to map CQL 
queries to that database. <BR><BR>A CQL qery term might look something like 
"title=dog". Somehow, that must get turned into the list of structure attributes 
that a Z39.50 server expects to see in query. There are six attributes that the 
Z39.50 server is expecting and the CQL parser that we use (the Open Source <A 
href="http://zing.z3950.org/cql/java/">CQL-Java</A> Parser from Mike Taylor) 
generates values for all of them. <BR><BR>
<H3>Attribute 1: Use</H3>The Use attribute is derived from the index part of the 
CQL query. In our example of "title=dog", the index is "title". You'll need to 
look in your Z39.50 configuration file to determine the value of the Use 
attribute to specify for that index. Typically, the value would be '4', if you 
use Bib-1 attributes. <BR><BR>To specify this in the SRW database configuration 
file, you would say:
<UL><B>qualifier.title = 1=4</B></UL>This means that when a term qualifier 
(index) of "title" is seen, then Z39.50 attribute 1 (Use) should be set to 4. 
<BR><BR>You can specify other names for the index as well. <B>qualifier.dc.title 
= 1=4</B>
<UL></UL>You will need to do this for all the indexes specified in you Z39.50 
configuration file. 
<H3>Attributes 2-6: Relation, Position, Structure, Truncation and 
Completeness</H3>Fortunately, these attributes are pretty static and can 
probably be copied from almost any other SRW database configuration file. 
<H2>Schema Mappings</H2>The native internal format is a Dublin Core record. If 
the search request does not specify a <I>recordSchema</I>, then the record will 
be returned in that Dublin Core schema. If the server is to support other 
schemas (e.g. <A href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/">MARC-XML</A>, <A 
href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/">MODS</A>, <A 
href="http://www.editeur.org/">ONIX</A>), then a mapping to those schemas must 
be provided. The mapping mechanism uses XSLT. <BR><BR>To enable schema support, 
a list of the supported schemas must be provided in the database configuration 
file. This list consists of a single line that begins <B>xmlSchemas=</B> and is 
followed by a list of the schema ID's that are to be supported. The names 
provided in the list are exactly the names that must be provided in the 
recordSchema parameter of the searchRetrieve request. If a schema is to be known 
by more than one ID then both ID's must be provided in the list. (e.g. Dublin 
Core might be known both as http://www.loc.gov/zing/srw/dcschema/v1.0/ and as 
DC.) An example of an xmlSchemas list would be: 
<UL><B>xmlSchemas=http.//www.loc.gov/zing/srw/dcschema/v1.0/, dc, 
  http.//www.loc.gov/marcxml, marcxml</B></UL><I>Note: due to a pecularity of java 
properties files, you can't use colons. So, replace the colon with a period. I 
promise that it will work correctly when the user specifies the schema ID using 
a colon.</I> <BR><BR>In addition to the list, the location of an XSLT 
transformation file must be provided for each schema. (Well, if no 
transformation is necessary, (i.e., the requested schema is the default schema) 
then no XSLT file is necessary.) A line should be provided that begins with the 
schema ID, followed by an equals-sign and the name of the XSLT file. For 
example: 
<UL><B>marcxml=DcToMarcXml.xsl</B><BR><B>http.//www.loc.gov/marcxml=DcToMarcXml.xsl</B></UL>The 
SRW server assumes that the XSL file specification is the complete pathname of 
the file. If it isn't, then the server looks for that file, first in the db.home 
directory and then in the SRW.Home directory. <BR><BR>At present, there are no 
XSLT files for transforming DSpace Dublin Core records to other schemas. I'm 
hoping that the community will make them available. If this happens, I will be 
glad to incorporate them in this package and/or point at them from this 
document. <BR><BR>
